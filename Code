Help Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and others stop the Dark Lord Sauron from retaking the Ring and taking over Middle Earth! *Gandalf* can claim if Sauron is not in his daykilling mode or dead, as he is essentially a bomb. But danger can come from any side, as the rogue wizard Saruman is also amassing his forces from Isengard, and other dangerous creatures hide in every nook and cranny ready to prey on the forces of good.

Changed Ring-Bearer Gollum's poison into a 25% chance to have -9999 votes instead of 9999. Lowered hax on slice.

Changed Frodo's role entirely - he now puts the Ring on during the day and the members of the Fellowship + Sauron get a chance to hax him. Sam's chance is much higher.",
